# CircleCI 2.0 configuration file for this project.
#
# Notes:
#   - Do not use CircleCI's brand of Docker images unless it is for a secondary environment.
#   - We chose not to use dependencies caching because it is complicated to do it right and it is
#     not worth the effort for a project so small.
#
